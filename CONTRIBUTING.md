# Contributing Guide

Thank you for taking the time to contribute to the Istio Course Project! This guide provides information on how you can help and how we ask contributors to maintain consistency and quality.

## Contributing Best Practices

- **Code Standards**: Follow Markdown standards (e.g., proper use of headers, bullet points, and inline code).
- **Branching**: Create a unique feature branch (e.g., `feature/<topic-name>`) for each module or task before merging.
- **Commit Messages**: Use clear and descriptive commit messages (e.g., `Add: Lab guide for module 3` or `Fix: Lab 4 sidecar injection error`).

## Key Files
- **`TASKS.md`**: Always update the task status or milestones after completing a contribution.
- **`REVIEW_GUIDE.md`**: Refer for internal review and quality assurance.
